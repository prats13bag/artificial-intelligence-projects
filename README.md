_**About the project**_

The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's artificial intelligence course. The projects along with the complete course was adapted by our professor here at University of Illinois at Chicago. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects doesn't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. The projects allow us to visualize the results of the techniques implemented. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.
